===========================
Lack of cohesion of methods
===========================

Cohesion metrics measure how well methods of a class are related to each other.
A cohesive class has one responsibility. A non-cohesive class more unrelated
functions. Such classes need to be split into smaller classes.

With assumption, that methods are related if they work on the same class
variables.
Therefore, the more methods work on same class variables, the highest
is its cohesion.
